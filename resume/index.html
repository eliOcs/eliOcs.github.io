      In our third and last startup pivot we developed an app that teaches you
      history when walking around. When you walk by a historical site you will
      receive a notification with a short article which tells you an interesting
      story of what happened there. Our app was downloaded 500,000 times and
      used by more than 100,000 users each month, included more than 5,000
      geolocated history articles of Spain and London and received an average
      rating of 4.5 out of 5 from 2,000 reviews.<br />
      During this time we were granted with 50k€ and we managed to get 1% of the
      users to pay 6€ on average unfortunately we couldn't reach a large enough
      user base to create a profitable business.
    </p>

    <h4>Leadership</h4>
    <p>
      In this last stage we were 5 in the team although 2 were working full time
      on the content. During this stage our main focus was to take a data driven
      approach when taking decisions. We measured user activity and behaviour to
      learn which features made sense and which could be discarded. We started
      to control our software quality with metrics too and published to
      production apps with 99.5% crash-free sessions.

    <h4>Backend</h4>
    <p>
      I extended our backend so it could persist the progress of the users in
      our new app. The architecture had to handle the requests of thousands of
      users (more than 100 requests per second), we had no problem handling this
      load due to our scalable architecture.

      Lots of the effort was dedicated to develop a low-battery consumption
      algorithm to unlock content as the user passed through certain locations
      even with the application in background.

      In our second pivot we created an app builder. This app builder was
      created to allow city councils and bloggers to easily create apps that
      served as tourist guides. The user would create points on a map with
      photographs, descriptions, etc. and then an app would be created with that
      content automatically.<br />
      Our most important milestones during this time were: to be granted with
      206k€ by the Spanish government, to release 200 apps with our app builder
      and to reach more than 250,000 users. Unfortunately we couldn't convert
      city councils into paying customers and therefore failed to achieve a
      successful business model.
    </p>

    <h4>Leadership</h4>
    <p>
      In this second stage we were 4 in our team we had a frontend developer and
      a graphic designer working with us. Thanks to our previous well thought
      out architecture we managed to reuse great part of our previous
      technology.<br />
      We decided to develop our apps natively even though it meant duplicating
      the work because at the time no cross-platform development framework
      allowed us to achieve the product quality we desired.
    </p>
    <div class="tools-used">Agile development, SCRUM, Pivotal Tracker</div>

    <h4>Backend</h4>
    <p>
      Created a script to automatically create mobile apps. It downloaded the
      content the user had uploaded, built an offline map and created the apps
      from the iOS and Android templates. It was a real challenge to compress
      the offline maps so they didn't take lots of space in the apps.
    </p>
    <div class="tools-used">Bash, OpenStreetMaps</div>

    <h4>Browser</h4>
    <p>
      Modified our previous web based CMS to allow users to fill the app
      information and create apps from their content.
    </p>
    <div class="tools-used">HTML, JavaScript, CSS, LESS, Angular, Git</div>

    <h4>Android</h4>
    <p>
      Created a template app from which all our apps would be generated. The app
      was used as a tourist guide, it contained an offline map with the points
      of interest and each point had images and text. Users could log using
      their Facebook accounts to share, like or comment the points of interest.

      In this first stage our startup developed a location based social network.
      People collaborated in interest groups to locate things they liked on a
      map. For example a group could spot and locate: cool graffitis, vegan
      restaurants or fishing spots. We developed a working product for the web
      and iPhone where 1,000 users signed up but we failed to reach a critical
      mass of users for the product to generate real value.
    </p>

    <h4>Leadership</h4>
    <p>
      During this stage we were 4 in our team, we had a frontend developer and a
      graphic designer working with us. We successfully managed to ship a high
      quality product with very little resources and time. But, we did fail to
      build a simple product (MVP) as we jammed the product with too many
      features.<br />
      One of the best decisions we took was to split the platform into multiple
      services. One that took part of the core business logic providing web
      services to use it (API) and two other parts: the web client and the iOS
      app. Another key decision to keep costs down was to use only one
      programming language in almost all parts of the development which greatly
      reduced context switching improving our efficiency.
    </p>
    <div class="tools-used">Agile development, SCRUM, Pivotal Tracker</div>

    <h4>Backend</h4>
    <p>
      Thought out an architecture that would last and would be useful in the
      long run, the result was an stateless server that could be easily scaled.
      Offered a REST API to the web a mobile app clients to authenticate, upload
      content, chat and query content nearby.

    <h4>Browser</h4>
    <p>
      Created a dynamic web app that allowed users to upload images while
      interacting with a map to localize them which proved to be a challenge and
      a great learning experience.

    <p>
      Built an app that could do all the functionalities of our web. Users took
      pictures with the app and then the image was uploaded with the current
      user location. A map showed all the content around and users could chat
      with each other.
