        <h2>Vendor lock in nightmares</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Measure what matters</h2>
        <p>
          You can measure RAM and CPU usage or the latency of the database per
          query to find bottlenecks in your code, but how do you identify your
          <em>team's</em> performance issues? Five years ago I started tracking
