        <p>
          Enterprise customers demand complex permissions, but naive
          implementations that query on every request
          <em>will break at scale</em>. Learn how to shift from read-time
          queries to write-time pre-computation for fast reads, with working SQL

          How I used AI to migrate <em>970 test files with 6000+ test cases</em>
          from React Testing Library v13 to v14 in just one week. What would

        <p>
          I started my programming career with Java and eventually discovered
          Rich Hickey's <em>Simple Made Easy</em> philosophy. Today I share how
          to apply these principles to JavaScript: values over objects, data
          over syntax, and controlled state management. Simple doesn't mean
          familiar, <em>simple means untangled</em>...

        <p>
          Great engineering culture reduces time-to-value while protecting users
          and engineers. I find that <em>leading by example</em> is the best way
          to get your points across. From kindness and pragmatism to full-cycle
          ownership and fighting complexity, here's how I build teams that

        <p>
          At Filestage we've always heavily relied on third parties to build our
          product, we don't want to waste our time managing our database we want
          to fix our customer problems and focus on that. I'm very thankful to
          be able to build on the shoulders of giants, but I painfully came to
          learn that
          <em>not all vendors are at the same level</em>...

          Before we started our open trial at Filestage I wouldn't have imagined
          the amount of effort it would take us to fight spammers and other
          misuse of the platform. We aren't a big brand but still hundreds of
          bad actors show up in our trial, <em>the internet is wild</em>...

        <p>
          You can measure RAM and CPU usage or the latency of the database per
          query to find bottlenecks in your code, but how do you identify your
          <em>team's</em> performance issues? Five years ago I started tracking
