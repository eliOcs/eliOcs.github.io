- "How we built AI-powered review at Filestage"
- Realibility mesures that work: monitoring, alerts, health metrics, reduce noise with SLO (advanced). Root cause analysis.
- Writing good unit tests: mock the edges of your system not the implementation details or internal layers. Don't write unit tests per function or file write them per feature or behavior. In memory databases. HTTP mocking libraries. Why I dislike jest. Testing that you can trust. Why I think 100% coverage is a good idea.
