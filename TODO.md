# Plan
- Update linkedin
- Redesign website
- Write blog posts
- Collaborate in open source projects

# Blog articles ideas
- Writing good unit tests: mock the edges of your system not the implementation details or internal layers. Don't write unit tests per function or file write them per feature or behavior. In memory databases. HTTP mocking libraries. Why I dislike jest

# Resume

- Add referals to resume
