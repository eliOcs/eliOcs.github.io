      <h1>Simple JavaScript Toolkit</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      I started my programming career with a lot of Java. It is a great runtime
      but always felt too verbose for my liking and required lots of discipline
      to not overcomplicate code with unnecessary hierarchy relationships.
      Looking for alternatives I stumbled upon a lot of JVM languages like:
      Scala, Kotlin and eventually Clojure. Although I never liked the lisp
      syntax I appreciated it expressiveness. Eventually I got to find the many
      great talks from The author of Clojure, Rich Hickey. Today I would like to
      share how we can apply his

    <h2>Object and Methods vs Values and Functions</h2>
    <p>
      With the increasing popularity of React this functional programming
      paradigm has already been pushed pretty hard. Approaches are similar but
      have subtle differences, in objects you are tying the data and the
      behvaiour. As you start adding more behaviours you will end up with
      situations in which you want to reuse some behaviour and you are forced to
      create a complex object only to access a small part of it. As the author of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, said
"You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.¿
