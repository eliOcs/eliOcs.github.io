      <h1>Vendor lock in nightmares</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://filestage.io" target="_blank">Filestage</a> we've
      always heavily relied on third parties to build our product, we don't want
      to for example waste our time managing our database we want to focus on
      our core product and concentrate on fixing fix our customer problems. I'm
      very thankful to be able to build on the shoulders of giants, but I
      painfully came to learn that not all vendors are at the same level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our stack from the beginning heavily relied on AWS and after years of use
      we <strong>never experienced any downtime or problem whatsoever</strong>.
      Like every other web app we had our servers and database in EC2, we used a
      load balancer and S3. We got used to those levels of reliability and
      performance and <em>oh boy, was I wrong</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>Transloadit</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The first time I started to feel the pain</strong> is when we
      moved our video transcoding from AWS ElasticTranscoder to
      <a href="https://transloadit.com" target="_blank">Transloadit</a>. Our
      customers uploaded videos with many different codecs and formats that AWS
      didn't support and we saw a quick win changing our provider. Indeed it was
      easy to change, Transloadit has a great API and it is very easy to use. It
      even handles file upload so we also started using that. We immediately
      brought value to our customers it was great, the price was very
      competitive with AWS so we were happy with the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then we started to see some problems, Transloadit was a small
      bootstrapped startup at the time and was gaining traction and having
      struggles to scale.
      <strong>Suddenly our jobs took a lot of time to process</strong>, because
      our application's core is about uploading and sharing files so our
      customers started complaining all of a sudden.
      <strong>Worst of all, we couldn't do anything about it</strong>, we could
      only pass the complaints to Transloadit and wait for them to fix it.
      <em
        >We were at their mercy, we had no control over the situation and we
        were losing customers because of it</em
      >. Unfortunately this situation repeated itself many times, and in many
      different ways, sometimes videos had the wrong color or freezed in the
      middle, etc. It was a nightmare.
    </p>

      />

    </figure>
    <p>
      We worked a lot in the things we could change, we tried to decouple our UX
      as much as possible from the transcoding process. If non critical tasks
      like thumbnail generation we just failed silently, while the transcoding
      is taking place we allowed the user to continue using the app, if the file
      was webcompatible we loaded the original file, if the transcoding failed
      we let the user retry, etc. Eventually we also migrated some transcoding
      processes to our own implementation using opensource tools like:
      imagemagick, ffmpeg, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Auth0</h2>
    <p>
      Although this happened years ago <em>it still makes me angry</em>, I got
      hit by an <strong>unexpected 10x price increase</strong> that forced us to
      change our roadmap. Before we started using
      <a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0</a> we had our own
      authentication system, but we wanted to onboard enterprise customers and
      although we also had our own SSO implementation we didn't support as many
      protocols as Auth0 did. We started using Auth0 for our SSO customers and
      we were very happy with it, the pricing was fair, we paid like 50$ a month
      so it was a no brainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Auth0 was working great for us I decided to move all our
      authentication to their platform, <em>this was my first big mistake</em>.
      Although it removed unnecessary complexity from our codebase and meant we
      could focus on our core product it also meant we were now fully dependent
      on Auth0. Another down side is that we had to add complexity to achieve
      custom UX with Auth0, so in the end I didn't manage to reduce the
      complexity of our codebase as much as I expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years our usage grew and we started paying like $200 a month,
      which still was fair. But then
      <strong>Auth0 was acquired by Okta</strong>, Okta was a company that went
      public and had to show their promised growth to their shareholders. They
      introduced <strong>the most unfair pricing model I've ever seen</strong>
      to date, if you use Auth0 for a B2B product you pay more per active user
      than if you use it for a B2C product. Imagine you go and buy a shovel and
      they ask you if you are going to use it to dig your garden or dig out gold
      and depending on that they charge you more or less. This is what Auth0 did
      and is still present in their pricing page today.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >This made our costs skyrocket, we were now paying like $2000 a
        month</strong
      >. The worst part is that it didn't stop increasing, their new pricing
      plan didn't include unlimited SSO connections anymore so they forced us to
      pay per different SSO provider we integrated so they got a healthy cut for
      every enterprise customer too.
      <strong
        >We were now paying like $4000 a month and were locked in yearly
        contracts</strong
      >. <em>We had no choice but to accept it</em> but I was
      <strong>determined to leave Auth0 as soon as possible</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Migrating all our users to our own authentication system wasn't easy and
      we wanted to do it without any friction to our customers so this meant it
      was a long running migration. Thankfully over the years enterprise
      organizations have settled on a few SSO protocols so we only had to
      implement those. Thanks to opensource libraries which by the way are
      <em>exactly the ones Auth0 uses under the hood</em> we were able to
      implement the same features easily,
      <strong>our SSO service is currently 494 lines of code</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>MongoDB Atlas</h2>
    <p>
      Before using
      <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas</a> we
      hosted our MongoDB database in our own EC2 instance, which meant that from
      time to time we had to update the operating system and MongoDB versions
      ourselves. This is challenging if you want to do it with no downtime and
      the slowness to keep up with latest security patches adds risks. So we
      decided to migrate to this managed solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has served us really great during the years, we have been able to
      easily configure auto scaling to optimize costs and leverage solutions
      like their
      <a
        href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-search"
        target="_blank"
        >Atlas Search</a
      >
      to provide a search feature to our customers without having to spin up a
      separate ElasticSearch service and take care of syncing the data. Lately
      we are also splitting customer data by region to reduce latency and comply
      with data residency regulations and their global cluster and sharding
      features have made this easy to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we started depending on their cloud solution unfortunately in our
      local environments we stopped using a local MongoDB database as the
      feature set isn't the same. This made it trickier to implement integration
      tests and increased our vendor lock in. Fortunately they still have a fair
      pricing and good reliability but we are always at their mercy.

    <p>
      Another downside of PaaS is that you rely on their support to solve any
      critical production issues.
      <strong
        >You can't easily restart the instance or don't have full admin access
        to the database</strong
      >. That is when you learn the real downside,
      <strong
        >their support pricing model as many other PaaS services is completely
        unfair</strong
      >. You have the free support which is basically useless. MongoDB Atlas is
      mainly used by software developers so of course support questions are
      going to be somewhat technical and they are using that as a reason to
      redirect you to their paid support. Even once I was trying to make them
      aware of a bug in their UI and still they insisted on their paid support,
      a very frustrating experience.
    </p>

        alt="Support pricing increases with your usage"
      />
      <figcaption>Support pricing increases with your usage</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It somehow makes sense that you pay more for support if you are using more
      the platform because your use case is probably more complicated. But in my
      experience <em>you are rarely using support</em> so basically
      <strong>you are paying thousands of dollars for nothing</strong>. They
      also know this so if you enable/disable support they force you to pay for
      the last 3 months to reenroll, ludicrous.

    <p>
      <strong
        >Don't expect this expensive support to be managed by MongoDB
        experts</strong
      >
      in any way, in my experience
      <strong
        >we've paid thousands of dollars in support for very poor quality
        answers</strong
      >. Once we had a back and forth for weeks trying to understand a
      production issue and the problem was that their node.js driver doesn't
      support multiple queries in parallel (as in
      <code>await Promise.all</code>) when using sessions to achieve consistency
      but in their documentation they were talking about concurrency and node.js
      is a single threaded language so we misunderstood that. Unfortunately the
      support person we got didn't know node.js well enough so wasn't able to
      help us and it took weeks to finally figure it out ourselves.

    <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Don't assume all third party providers will have a great
        reliability</strong
      >, do your research. Check customer complains, their status pages or
      twitter accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Beware of unfair pricing models</strong>. It is common for
      technology to get cheaper over time but
      <em
        >software providers tend to get more expensive over time and arbitrarily
        change their pricing</em
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Understand the amount of vendor lock in you are committing to</strong
      >. Think ahead of time how much effort would it be to migrate out:
      <em
        >will you have to move data? are there alternatives? will it be easy to
        migrate without downtime?</em
      >
