      <h1>How I Build Engineering Culture</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      Great engineering culture <strong>reduces time-to-value</strong> while
      protecting users and engineers. It is easier said than done, I find that
      <strong>leading by example</strong> is the best way to get your points
      across. As engineers we hate politics and fluff we want to see meaning in
      what we do, actions mean more than words.
    </p>

    <h2>Kindness and Respect</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately you can't fake this one. Real trust and motivation will come
      naturally if you <em>truly care</em> about your team members. Show that
      you care by doing things for them, help them out when you need them the
      most, give them <strong>autonomy</strong> and allow them to make mistakes
      so they grow. <strong>Don't blame</strong> and
      <strong>assume positive intent</strong>. Share credit and celebrate wins.
      Share constructive feedback on a regular basis.
    </p>

      When you need to have a difficult conversation share the things you like
      first then share what you don't like with
      <strong>concrete examples</strong> so it easy to understand. If dealing
      with people doesn't come naturally to you, I highly recommend reading the
      popular How to

    <h2>Pragmatic: outcomes over output</h2>
    <p>
      At any point in time there are always many things you can do, that is why
      it is important to <strong>pick your battles wisely</strong>. Much better
      to have a heated argument on how we can we improve 10x the performance of
      that slow backend route than wasting time discussing if we should use
      single or double quotes for strings. Although the

      >
      is old, its still my favourite.

    <p>
      Tie work to <strong>user value</strong>, challenge concepts early to try
      and achieve <strong>80% of the value for 20% of the effort</strong>. Let's
      say you are building a new notification panel.

        Two different approaches to show unread notifications
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      What happens if the user has too many unread notifications? Will the
      number fit in the UI? Will the backend take too much time to calculate the
      total amount? Will we update the number as notifications are read?
      <em>Slow down, start again</em>. How about just showing the marker with no
      number in it? We can easily start with that and
      <strong>iterate later if necessary</strong>.

    </p>

    <h2>Reliability as habit</h2>
    <p>
      We've all experience the frustration of using a buggy product, it is
      awful. The user gets the worst part but at the same time the developer
      gets interrupted to <em>rework the unreliable implementation</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the work you deliver has <strong>monitoring built in</strong>.
      Think if is necessary to create an alert. Write
      <strong>tests that verify the behaviour</strong> and give you confidence
      every time you make a change. If you are in a already in a very unreliable
      codebase, first <em>take a step back and analyze the root cause</em> of
      the most common issues and fix them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all make mistakes and it is fine from time to time, but there is
      nothing more energy draining than having to fix the same issues over and
      over again.

    <h2>Full-cycle and Product-minded engineers</h2>
    <p>
      I've found giving <strong>autonomy</strong> to talented people is
      empowering, having <strong>one person end to end</strong> designing,
      building, testing, deploying and operating a
      <strong>thin vertical slice</strong> of software. It is a good investment
      to provide tools that allow engineers to comfortably be able to
      <a
        href="https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249"
        target="_blank"
        >take ownership of each stage of the software development lifecycle</a
      >.

        target="_blank"
        >Product-minded engineers</a
      >
      focus their interest in the product they are building, its users, and the
      business context. Are <strong>proactive</strong> towards product
      development, try to understand the <em>"why"</em> behind decisions. They
      <strong>balance product and engineering tradeoffs</strong>, handling edge
      cases pragmatically, and owning the product feature lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your technology stack allows for it, I'm also very fond of
      <strong>full-stack engineers</strong>. Every time you can
      <strong>eliminate a handoff</strong> you are reducing friction and
      improving communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Especially in remote teams, <strong>transparency is key</strong>. You need
      to <strong>share all the context early</strong> and track decisions to
      make sure everyone has the best information and a complete picture to do
      the best work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Overcommunicate</strong> if necessary. Explain the biggest
      challenges and how we are going to tackle them. Share the vision and the
      goals. Ask the team to <em>explain the strategy back to you</em> to test
      how good your communication was.
    </p>

    <h2>Think Big, Start Small, Move Fast</h2>
    <p>
      Split problems into <strong>small pieces</strong> which can be done in
      <strong>1-3 days</strong>, use <strong>feature flags</strong> to hide work
      in progress and showcase feature to beta customers as soon as you have a
      working solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to enforce a CI check that
      <strong>disallows merging PRs that are over 500 lines</strong> of code
      changes and make sure
      <strong>every merged PR is deployed to production</strong>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img

        alt="A sample run of a solid CI/CD pipeline"
      />
      <figcaption>A sample run of a solid CI/CD pipeline</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Make sure you have <strong>safety nets in place</strong> to give the
      confidence to your team to move fast. The
      <strong>CI/CD pipeline should be solid</strong>: static code analysis
      (linting, type checking, duplicates ...), there should be
      <strong>E2E in place for the most critical paths</strong> and have
      integrations or unit tests for most of the code base.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture to match the business</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a big fan of
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134434420/ref=emc_b_5_i"
        target="_blank"
        >Domain Driven Design (DDD)</a
      >
      or <strong>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)</strong> frameworks, analyse the problem
      you are working on and split it up in manageable chunks which
      <strong>have meaning for your end user</strong>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="./product-based-team-structure.png"
        alt="Team structure that mirrors the product structure"
      />
      <figcaption>Team structure that mirrors the product structure</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The
      <strong>team structure should mirror the structure of the software</strong
      >. The code base structure should mimic this structure too. The
      <strong>same terms our users use</strong>, our product team uses
      <strong>should be in our code base</strong>. We have to work to eliminate
      barriers to communication and avoid unnecessary complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>Operational excellence over DevOps</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the meaning of DevOps has really been lost over the years in
      the software community. I really like following the structure shared by
      the
      <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/"
        target="_blank"
        >AWS Well-Architected framework</a
      >. Thankfully the software industry shares its best secrets openly. We can
      quickly check best practices and benchmark metrics to
      <a href="https://dora.dev/quickcheck/" target="_blank"
        >understand where you are</a
      >
      and what is missing to become an elite team.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the number of employees grows and the time working on the project
      increases, the most value you are going to get from
      <strong>every operation improvement</strong>. As you grow in number of
      users the more value you will get from investments in
      <strong>reliability, performance and security</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start <a href="../measure-what-matters/">measuring what matters</a> to
      understand your main bottlenecks, then work to improve and track your
      progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Kind but direct communication</strong>,
      <strong>iteration over grand plans</strong>,
      <strong>user empathy</strong>, <strong>high standards</strong>,
      <strong>pragmatic execution</strong>, and don't forget to
      <strong>fight complexity</strong>
      or it will end up stalling your progress.
