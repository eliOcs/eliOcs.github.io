      <h1>Permission Systems for Enterprise that Scale</h1>

    <p>
      Many startups eventually gravitate towards enterprise customers for bigger
      tickets and long-term contracts. As enterprise customers start using your
      product they soon demand advanced permissions systems to manage their
      different user roles and access levels. A naive implementation of the
      permission checks works perfectly fine at first but as they start to use
      more and more your platform the amount of data, users and relationships
      will put that implementation to the test. Soon your biggest paying
      customer will be threatening to leave because your app is just too slow
      for them to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this problem we will use a simple example. Imagine an app
      which has folders and files where an 'admin' can see all folders and files
      but 'standard' users can only see files and folders they've created or
      have been shared with them.
    </p>

    <h2>The Naive Approach (read-time permission queries)</h2>

    <p>
      Your first intuition will be to query the database on every request to
      calculate the permissions and the data that the user can access. First you
      will check the role of the user in the team, is the user an admin or an
      standard user. If the user is not at admin then query for all the
      resources the user has created or has been shared with.
